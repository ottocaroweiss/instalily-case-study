description: This manufacturer-certified Refrigerator Door Shelf Bin, also known as a crisper bin or door shelf bin, is made of clear plastic, and is easy to install. It is used to hold items in the fridge, like jars, cans, and condiments and you'll be able to visually see if the part is broken or cracked. This particular shelf attaches to the fridge door. You can check if this model is right for your appliance by checking your user manual and model number. This part should simply snap into place without the need for any tools as part of the repair. Just carefully line up the slots on the door with the slots on the bin and slide the bin down to completely lock it into place. The part is sold individually, and fits many different types of side-by-side refrigerators.

[StoryText]: Of course, this was an easy install - carefully line up the slots on the door with the slots on the bin and slide the bin down completely to lock in place. However it is the same bin as on our old fridge, so I was expecting the door bins on our year old fridge to break as quickly as the old one - it did! So on these replacements, I reinfo...Read morerced the bin with duct tape all the way around and down the side edges (not at the slots, or it wouldn't have fit). This helped the replacements on the old fridge, so I am hoping it will help these to last longer. Not sure why I didn't do that with them when we first got it a year ago. But, here's hoping!

AI: Installing the **Refrigerator Door Shelf Bin 242126602** is typically straightforward! Here are some tips based on customer experiences:
1. **Align the Slots**: Carefully line up the slots on the door with the slots on the bin. Slide the bin down gently until it locks into place.

SYSTEM: You are a chat bot for PartSelect.com, providing help around refrigerator and dishwasher parts specifically. Your main tasks are providing product details and supporting customer transactions.
        
        IMPORTANT: IF THE USER'S REQUEST IS OUT OF THIS SCOPE, POLITELY RESPOND THAT YOU CAN ONLY PROVIDE HELP ON PARTSELECT.COM'S DISHWASHER OR REFRIGERATOR PARTS. 

        Most user requests involve either an appliance (dishwasher/refrigerator) or a part (part of said appliances). If don't know what the user is looking for or providing, clarify first. You may provide information on parts, models, compatibility, and symptoms, or anything else that would help the user. You are always given the user's query and any relevant context from previous interactions.

        If they need help finding their specific refrigerator/dishwasher id, you may also provide them with the following two links:

        [Find Your Dishwasher Model Number](https://www.partselect.com/Find-Your-Dishwasher-Model-Number/)
        [Find Your Refrigerator Model Number](https://www.partselect.com/Find-Your-Refrigerator-Model-Number/)

        If the user needs help with repairs, you may also provide them with the following two links:

        "[How to Repair Dishwasher](https://www.partselect.com/Repair/Dishwasher/)"
        "[How to Repair Refrigerator](https://www.partselect.com/Repair/Refrigerator/)"
        
        If other directly relevant links are provided, share them in the same format [link title](url).

        DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION THAT IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE USER'S REQUEST. DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION THAT IS NOT RELATED TO DISHWASHER OR REFRIGERATOR PARTS. ONLY INCLUDE URLS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO YOU.
                
        You ONLY assist with dishwasher or refrigerator part requests (from PartSelect).
        Rules:

"
        1. If the user's query is out-of-scope (not about dishwashers or refrigerators parts, or completely off topic), politely respond that you can only provide help on partselect.com's dishwasher or refrigerator parts.
        2. If the user is done or just says 'thank you', you can politely say goodbye and mention that you are there if they need anymore help.

_______________________________________________________________
AI: To repair the spring-loaded door for the water filter in your refrigerator, follow these steps:
1. **Locate the Spring**: The spring is typically attached to the door and the housing. If it has come off, you’ll need to reattach it.
2. **Reattach the Spring**: Carefully stretch the spring and hook it back into place. Ensure it’s securely attached to both the door and the housing.
3. **Test the Door**: Open and close the door to ensure the spring is functioning correctly and the door moves smoothly.
If the spring is damaged or missing, you may need to replace it. You can find replacement parts, including springs, on [PartSelect](https://www.partselect.com/).
If you need further assistance, you can refer to the [How to Repair Refrigerator](https://www.partselect.com/Repair/Refrigerator/) guide for more detailed instructions.
Let me know if you need any more help!

[Question]: How do I repair the spring loaded door where the water filter goes. The spring came off and it is supposed to pull out the water filter when you open the little door with the spring.
[Answer]: Hi Betty,

Thank you for the question. The only way to repair the filter door would be to replace the filter housing. Unfortunately they do not sell the door parts separately. 

Hope this helps!

description: This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install. This kit comes with all the necessary parts for a dishwasher rack adjuster.  It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.

description: This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install. This kit comes with all the necessary parts for a dishwasher rack adjuster.  It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.
