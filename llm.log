AI: Great! Your dishwasher model number is **2213222N414**, and you mentioned it's leaking. Let's narrow this down. Here are the most common parts that could cause a leak in your dishwasher:
1. **Door Gasket/Seal** - A worn or damaged door gasket can allow water to leak out during cycles.
2. **Water Inlet Valve** - A faulty valve might cause overfilling or improper water flow, leading to leaks.
3. **Drain Pump or Hose** - A cracked or clogged drain hose or pump can cause water to leak from the bottom.
4. **Tub or Tub Seal** - Cracks in the tub or a damaged seal can also lead to leaks.
You can explore all the parts for your model here: [2213222N414 Kenmore Dishwasher Parts](https://www.partselect.com/Models/2213222N414/Parts/).
